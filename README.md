# ðŸ¤– Fundamental of Robotics â€“ Assignments Portfolio

This repository contains a series of practical assignments completed as part of the **"Fundamentals of Robotics"** course. Each task focuses on a different aspect of robotic manipulation: from kinematics and trajectory planning to dynamics.

These assignments demonstrate core competencies in robotic systems development â€” relevant to both low-level control (e.g., FK/IK, Jacobian, dynamics) and high-level motion planning (e.g., trajectory generation and synchronization). The code is written in Python, with symbolic and numerical solutions developed from scratch.
