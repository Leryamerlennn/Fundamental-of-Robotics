# ðŸ¤– Robotic Manipulator Modeling & Control â€“ Full Stack Assignments Portfolio

This repository contains a structured series of practical assignments completed as part of the **Fundamentals of Robotics** course.

From modeling a 6-DOF manipulator to simulating dynamic motion and torque, these tasks cover the full stack of robotic arm development â€” including kinematics, differential analysis, trajectory planning, and dynamics.  
The entire pipeline is implemented in **Python** using symbolic (`sympy`) and numerical (`numpy`) methods â€” **from scratch**, without robotics libraries.
